# Design for AST:

- Each node is equivalent to an expression

- An expression can be anything - a constant, a variable, an operator applied to operands


## Formulae

- A Formula is an expression where the operand is `==`

- The TLAPlusModule is a list of these formulae

- Each Formula has a name on the left, with a value on the right

- the right has to be a boolean expression

- the left is an operand type, used in other expressions later


## Operator list

### Boolean operators

| operator    	 | type    | example |
|--------| ------- | ------- |
| /\ | binary | a /\ b |
| \/ | binary | a \\/ b |
| ~  | unary | ~ a |
| => | binary | a => b |
| <=> | binary | a <=> b |


### Integer operators

| operator    	 | type    | example |
|--------| ------- | ------- |
| > | binary | a > b |
| < | binary | a < b |
| >= | binary | a >= b |
| <= | binary | a <= b |
| + | binary | a + b |
| - | binary | a - b |
| * | binary | a * b |
| .. | binary | a..b |



## Structure:

- Every class inherits from the root class TLAPlusASTNode.

- Each class must have a toStringBuilderList() function, which generates a list of strings that represent all its descendants, with subsequent elements of the list assumed to be in separate lines.

- The line feature is meant to be used mainly by /\ and \/, in accordance with TLA+ standard practice.

- Indentation is handled by appending tabs by the parent

- The top-level module class has a toString() function, that handles the overall pretty-printing and formatting. This is not the responsibility of the AST classes

- Alternatively, the AST classes can be entirely agnostic about the string representation but this won't really work - the string stuff has to be implemented somewhere, and having a separate class is unergonomic, since it requires copuling the creation of a new AST class with a string function.

- Formulae can also be functions with arguments - a general function class is required. Stuff like cardinality is also a function.

- An Exp class consists of a list of subexpressions, this is an abstract class.

- An ANDExp class is one where the operator is fixed as "/\" and has exactly two subexpressions, and so on.

- change of plan - string used instead of StringBuilder, performance doesn't matter at this stage

## Formulae:

- Formulae are of the form A == B
- Complicated by parameterized formulae, where A can have variables bound to it
- The expression B can make use of these bound variables, but these cannot be used elsewhere
- Enforcing this can be done by a check of the AST - every variable used at any point must be defined in the global list, or in the formula itself
- Formula constructors need to have a list of variables
- Formulae can be part of an expression, and when it's used in an expression, the parameters are themselves replaced with actual expressions
- In general, the formula itself can be described as an expression with a children array the length of the number of parameters
- The enforcement of abstract variables in the LHS of the definition and the use of concrete expressions in the RHS is left to the Module class, not done at the AST level.

## Class hierarchy:

- TLAPlusASTNode is the root of all classes.

- TLAPlusAtom is the class for things that have a name and nothing else, when turned into a string. This includes constants, variables, literals (strings and ints)

- TLAPlusExp is for things that get expanded out - these have children, which are either atoms or expressions. These don't have a name field, the name info is supposed to be captured by the class type.
