## things:

- note start with _
- inconsistency in name of model
- make it consistently add everywhere
- maybe use two different types of add? useful for showing difference
- TLAplusFQN
- name the things after the thing
- arg-name-of.

in general - avoid breaking up functions



- what if Alloy does things in a roundabout way? explicit non-support
